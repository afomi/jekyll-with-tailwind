Taking control of your online presence starts with owning your own website. Unlike social media platforms where algorithms decide who sees your content, your website is truly yours.

## Why Build Your Own Website?

There are several compelling reasons to manage your own website:

1. **Ownership** - Your content lives on your domain, not someone else's platform
2. **No algorithms** - Visitors see exactly what you publish, in the order you choose
3. **Longevity** - Social platforms come and go, but your domain is yours forever
4. **Flexibility** - Complete control over design, layout, and functionality

## Getting Started

This template makes it easy to get started:

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Customize the colors in `assets/css/tailwind.css`
3. Update the content in your pages
4. Deploy to GitHub Pages (free!) or your preferred host

## Customizing Your Site

Check out the [design system](/design) to see all the available colors, typography, and components. The theme uses CSS custom properties, making it simple to change the entire color palette by editing a few values.

## What's Next?

Once you have your site running, you can:

- Add more pages for different sections
- Write blog posts to share your thoughts
- Connect your custom domain
- Add analytics to understand your visitors

The possibilities are endless when you own your platform.
